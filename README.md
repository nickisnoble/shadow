## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
1. Update `bower.json` & `package.json` with your new theme's info
1. Run `$ npm istall && bower install && grunt compile`
1. Install it as a theme, happy developing!

## Usage

Shadow uses [Grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com/) to process stylesheets, but it can do a lot more. I've set up two commands as a starting point:

**`$ grunt`** - Watches for changes, and then processes on save.

**`$ grunt compile`** - Processes once.

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
1. Create your feature branch: `$ git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature dev`
1. Commit your changes: `$ git commit -m 'Add some feature'`
1. Push to the branch: `$ git push origin feature/my-new-feature`
1. Submit a pull request :D
